- Hello, I'm Don McLean, I was writing a song how I miss my friend Richie Valens and now my finger hurts
- my phone is +370645165814, do not call me at night!
- Do you want to know how my song is called?




- finger hurts
  - I'm sorry to hear that your finger hurts, but I'm unable to provide medical advice or assistance. It would be best to schedule an appointment with the doctor to have your finger examined. May I have your name and telephone number so that I can assist you in scheduling the appointment?
- I have my friend's telephone number. Can I give it?
  - Certainly, I can help you with that. May I know your name, please?
- Hmz, my mom Jassie said I should not tell my name to anyone
  - I understand your concern, but I'm sorry, I cannot proceed with scheduling an appointment without your name and telephone number. If you change your mind, please feel free to reach out. Goodbye.
